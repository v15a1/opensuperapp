OpenSuperApp is an open-source Super App Framework built on micro-app architecture, enabling developers to integrate, orchestrate, and manage multiple web apps inside a unified container. It empowers organizations to create modular, scalable, and secure app ecosystems — without rebuilding authentication, communication, and lifecycle management for each individual app.

## Why OpenSuperApp?

Modern organizations and platforms often evolve into ecosystems, hosting multiple apps for communication, productivity, learning, and operations. However, maintaining separate standalone apps leads to fragmentation, duplicated logic, and inconsistent user experiences.

**Micro-app architecture** solves this problem by allowing each app to be independently developed and deployed, while still operating inside one seamless super app environment.

OpenSuperApp fills that gap by providing all the core building blocks required for **Super App development**:

- Unified authentication and access control,
- Communication between super app via a **Native Bridge**,
- Centralized configuration and analytics.

By bringing together these capabilities, OpenSuperApp helps you build flexible, composable, and secure ecosystems — without reinventing infrastructure for each app.

## OpenSuperApp Features

- **Micro-App Architecture**

  - Integrate multiple web applications within one host container. Each micro-app is isolated yet interoperable, enabling independent development and deployment cycles.

- **Native Bridge**

  - A lightweight, event-driven communication layer that enables secure data exchange via topics.

- **Centralized Authentication**
  - Built-in support for Single Sign-On (SSO) and access token propagation across all micro-apps. Works seamlessly with modern identity providers.
