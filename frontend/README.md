# 🚀 Super App Mobile (React Native \+ Expo)

The **Mobile App** is an all-in-one platform designed to bring essential tools and services to your fingertips for a seamless mobile experience. Built with **React Native + Expo**, **TypeScript**, and **Redux**, this Super App integrates secure authentication via **Asgardeo**, a micro-app architecture, and a dynamic app store for downloading and managing features.

---

## 📌 Super App Mobile Overview

This Super App serves as a **container** for multiple micro-apps. It:

- Authenticates users using **Asgardeo IAM**.
- Fetches and downloads **micro-apps** from a store.
- Handles **micro-app authentication and token exchange**.
- Manages state using **Redux** with **Redux Thunk**.
- Uses AsyncStorage for lightweight, client-side persistence of non-sensitive data (ideal for small key-value storage needs, not intended as a full database). For sensitive values, the app uses Secure Storage to encrypt and safely store confidential information such as user preferences, authentication tokens, and protected configuration data.

---

## 🔄 Super App Mobile Flow

### **High-Level Overview**

1. User installs & opens the app for the first time

   - App fetches **latest events and news** and **caches** them for 24 hours.

2. Default landing tab is `FEED`

3. User can navigate:

   - To **Library** tab → Articles are fetched from **Library API**.
   - To **Store/Profile** tabs → Prompt to **Sign In** is displayed.

4. If user signs in:

   - Retrieve **access_token & refresh_token** via **Asgardeo IAM**.
   - Fetch **user configurations** and **profile info**.
   - Align locally installed apps with server-side configurations (install/uninstall accordingly).

5. Show:

   - **My Apps** tab → User's micro apps.
   - **Store** tab → App management functions (update, delete, download).
   - **Profile** tab → Profile details and sign-out option.

6. On re-open, the app:

   - Starts at the **My Apps** tab.
   - Checks for a **Super App force update**. If required, the update screen is shown.
   - Checks if any **micro-apps have updates** and updates them automatically.

    actor User
    participant Super App
    participant IAM as Identity and Access Management (IAM) - Asgardeo
    participant Choreo as API Gateway - Choreo

    User ->> Super App: Open Mobile Application
    Super App ->> IAM: Authorize using client_id of Super App
    IAM -->> Super App: Asgardeo access_token + refresh_token
    Super App ->> Choreo: Resource Access (using IAM access_token)
    Choreo -->> Super App: Resource data
    Super App -->> User: Application loads
```

## 📦 Micro-App Management

### How Micro-Apps Work

1. Micro-apps are listed in the Super App Store.
2. Users can download micro-apps from the store.
3. Downloaded micro-apps are stored using AsyncStorage.
4. When launched, authentication tokens are exchanged for access.
5. The micro-app uses IAM access tokens to communicate with the Choreo API Gateway.

### How Micro-App Updates Work

- The Super App Store checks for updates.
- If an update is available, the micro-app is re-downloaded and replaced.

    Micro App ->> Choreo: Resource Access (using IAM access_token)
    Choreo -->> Micro App: Resource data
    Micro App -->> User: Loads Micro App
```

### How to Create a Micro app

1. Micro-apps are created using **React** and should be built as static web applications.

2. Create a new project:

```shell
npx create-react-app microapp_name
```

3. Communication with a micro app happens using a **native bridge**. Topics are used to establish a secure two way communication stream between the web based micro app and the super app. The native bridge can be found in the following path:

   - `utils/bridge.ts`

4. After creating your micro app, build it:

```shell
npm run build
```

- This will generate following files inside the `build` folder of your project.

```shell
build/
├── static/
├── index.html
├── asset-manifest.json
├── manifest.json
...
```

5. Add a `microapp.json` file to the build folder with the following attributes:

```json
{
  "name": "Micro App Name",
  "description": "A brief description of the micro app",
  "promoText": "Promotional text for the micro app",
  "appId": "unique-app-id",
  "iconUrl": "hosting-url-for-icon.png",
  "bannerImageUrl": "hosting-url-for-banner.png",
  "isMandatory": 0,
  "clientId": "client-id-for-authentication-if-integrated",
  "displayMode": "Controls whether to hide the header ('fullscreen') or show it ('default'). If no value is provided, it defaults to 'default'",
  "versions": [
    {
      "version": "version no",
      "build": "build no",
      "releaseNotes": "release notes",
      "downloadUrl": "url-to-hosted-zip-file-of-build-contents",
      "iconUrl": "hosting-url-for-version-icon.png"
    }
  ]
}
```

6. Zip the contents of the `build` directory and deploy it to your hosting site.

   - Also deploy the **icon** and **banner** of your micro-app.

7. Update the database tables `micro_app` and `micro_app_version` with details such as:

   - Micro-app ID, name, description, icon URL, banner image URL, download URL, etc.

   <br></br>
   <img src="../resources/micro_app_version.png" alt="Micro App Version Database Table" width="700"/>

8. After this, you should see the deployed app in the **store**.

9. Additionally, you can restrict micro-app visibility by groups using the `micro_app_role` table and mentioning groups in the role column.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Create and Configure the Environment File

First, copy the example environment file to create your local configuration:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

- This will create a `.env` file. Make sure to update the values according to your project requirements.
- Please note that the authenticator app–related URL in `.env` is required only for the WSO2 Super App. If your app does not need it, you can safely remove those variables.
- For **EAS Build** and **over-the-air updates**, set `EAS_PROJECT_ID` and, for local native builds, `EXPO_PUBLIC_UPDATES_CHANNEL` (`development` or `production`). See [Over-the-air (OTA) updates](#over-the-air-ota-updates-eas-update).

#### 1.1. (Optional) How to add/remove Firebase plugins if you are using Firebase.

To add or remove Firebase plugins from your app, open the `frontend/integrations/firebase/withFirebase.ts` file. In this file, you will find a constant named `FIREBASE_PLUGINS`, which contains an array of strings corresponding to each Firebase plugin. Modifying this array by adding or removing a plugin's corresponding string will add or remove the plugin from the app.

#### 1.2. (Optional) If you are using `Firebase Services`, enable the feature flag in the `.env` file:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FIREBASE=true
```

> Note: An `npx expo prebuild` should be executed each time this value is updated to apply the config changes.

#### 1.3. (Optional) If you are using `Firebase Services`, generate Base64 for Firebase Configuration

To use Firebase services, you need to convert your `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) and `google-services.json` (Android) files into Base64 strings.

##### 1.3.1 On MacOS

```bash
# For iOS: Encodes the file and copies the string to your clipboard
base64 -i path/to/your/GoogleService-Info.plist | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy

# For Android: Encodes the file and copies the string to your clipboard
base64 -i path/to/your/google-services.json | tr -d '\n' | pbcopy
```

##### 1.3.2 On Linux

```bash
# For iOS: Encodes the file and prints the string to the terminal
base64 -w 0 path/to/your/GoogleService-Info.plist

# For Android: Encodes the file and prints the string to the terminal
base64 -w 0 path/to/your/google-services.json
```

##### 1.3.3 On Windows (using PowerShell):

```powershell
# For iOS:
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("path\to\your\GoogleService-Info.plist"))

# For Android:
[Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("path\to\your\google-services.json"))
```

Paste the generated strings into the `FIREBASE_IOS_PLIST_B64` and `FIREBASE_ANDROID_JSON_B64` variables in your `.env` file.

#### 1.4. (Optional) If you are using the `Wallet pass` feature for the digital business card, enable the feature flag in the `.env` file:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_WALLET_PASS=true
```

This is the build-time switch for the "Save Business Card" action that adds the card to Apple Wallet or Google Wallet. It needs a wallet-pass-service deployment behind `EXPO_PUBLIC_WALLET_SERVICE_BASE_URL`; left unset, the action is disabled and the app never calls the service.

Rollout per operating system is done with Firebase Remote Config, so either platform can be turned on (or pulled) without a release. Create a single JSON parameter named `wallet_pass_enabled` in **Firebase Console > Remote Config**:

```json
{ "ios": true, "android": false }
```

`ios` controls the Apple Wallet `.pkpass` path and `android` the Google Wallet save-link path; the two depend on separate certificates and separate console onboarding, which is why either has to be switchable on its own. Fields are keyed by `Platform.OS`, so a platform that is absent — or set to anything other than `true` — is off. The schema lives in `types/remoteConfig.types.ts` (`WalletPassConfig`) and defaults to both off in `config/remoteConfig.ts`.

The env flag and the remote config both have to say yes: either one off disables the feature. That is also what happens when `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FIREBASE` is false, since the config then falls back to its `false` defaults.

### 2. Update the `app.config.ts` file with plugins

If you use Firebase **OR** _any other library_ that requires `config plugins` or `custom native modules`, you must add the necessary plugins to your `app.config.ts` file. For specific instructions on the Firebase setup, refer to the official [React Native Firebase](https://rnfirebase.io/) documentation.

See an example of how to add the Firebase plugins to the Plugins array:

```json
"plugins": [
   "plugin-1",
   "plugin-2",
   "plugin-3",
   [
      "plugin-4-with-configs",
      {
         {"some_configuration": true}
      }
   ]
]
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

With your `.env` file configured, run the following command to install all necessary packages.

```bash
npm install
```

> **Note:** The `postinstall` script will automatically run, which performs two key actions:
>
> 1. If provided, it decodes the `FIREBASE_IOS_PLIST_B64` and `FIREBASE_ANDROID_JSON_B64` variables from your `.env` file and creates the `google-services/GoogleService-Info.plist` and `google-services/google-services.json` files.
> 2. It installs dependencies in the root directory to set up Husky for pre-commit hooks.

### 4. Start the Application

You are now ready to start the Expo development server:

```bash
npx expo start

# npx expo run:{ios/android} if you are using native modules
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [Development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start development by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

---

## Deployment

1. Update `app.config.ts`.

   - Modify values such as app name, version, slug, package name, etc., according to your project through the `.env` file.

2. Follow the official Expo documentation for the next steps.

   - https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/

## Over-the-air (OTA) updates (EAS Update)

The Super App shell (JavaScript bundle and assets) can be updated **without** resubmitting to the App Store or Play Store using [EAS Update](https://docs.expo.dev/eas-update/introduction/). This is separate from:

- **Micro-app updates** — web bundles re-downloaded from your backend store.
- **Native force update** — the `update` screen that sends users to the store when a new native binary is required.

### Channels and build profiles

OTA updates use **two channels only**, defined in `eas.json`:

| EAS build profile | Update channel   | Typical use                          |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `development`     | `development`    | Internal builds, dev client, testing |
| `production`      | `production`     | Store / production releases          |

A binary only receives updates published to **its** channel. A `development` build never sees `production` updates, and vice versa.

### Required environment variables

Set these in `.env` (see `.env.example`):

| Variable | Purpose |
| -------- | ------- |
| `EAS_PROJECT_ID` | Links the app to your Expo project; used in `app.config.ts` for the updates URL (`https://u.expo.dev/<project-id>`). |
| `EXPO_PUBLIC_UPDATES_CHANNEL` | **`development`** or **`production`**. Required for **local** native builds so `plugins/withUpdatesChannel.ts` embeds the correct channel in the binary. EAS cloud builds set the channel from `eas.json` automatically. |

`runtimeVersion` uses the **`appVersion`** policy (from `APP_VERSION` in `.env`). OTA updates only apply to binaries whose runtime version matches the update. Bump `APP_VERSION` and ship a new native build when you change native code or dependencies that require a rebuild.

### Build native binaries

Use EAS Build with the matching profile (channel is applied automatically):

```bash
# Development (dev client, internal distribution)
npx --yes @dotenvx/dotenvx run -f .env -- eas build --profile development --platform android
npx --yes @dotenvx/dotenvx run -f .env -- eas build --profile development --platform ios

# Production
npx --yes @dotenvx/dotenvx run -f .env -- eas build --profile production --platform android
npx --yes @dotenvx/dotenvx run -f .env -- eas build --profile production --platform ios
```

**Local builds:** set `EXPO_PUBLIC_UPDATES_CHANNEL` to the same channel as the profile (`development` or `production`), then run prebuild/build. Example npm scripts:

```bash
npm run build:android:development:apk   # development channel
npm run build:ios:development
npm run build:ios:production
```

### Publish an OTA update

Publish JavaScript/asset changes to a channel (both platforms):

```bash
# Development channel
MESSAGE="Fix login redirect" npm run update:development

# Production channel
MESSAGE="1.0.1 bug fixes" npm run update:production
```

`MESSAGE` is required and describes the update in the Expo dashboard.

The app checks for updates **on load** (`checkAutomatically: "ON_LOAD"` in `app.config.ts`). Users get the new bundle on the next cold start after the update is downloaded.

### When you need a new native build (not OTA)

Publish a new **EAS Build** (and store submission if applicable) when you change:

- Native modules, `app.config.ts` plugins, or permissions
- `APP_VERSION` / runtime version (if you want OTA to target only new binaries)
- Anything that is not delivered as JS/assets via EAS Update

## 🛠️ Debugging & Common Issues

### Authentication Issues

❌ **Problem**: Login fails or returns an error.  
✅ **Solution**:

- Ensure `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_REDIRECT_URI` are correct.
- Check Asgardeo configurations (Redirect URIs & OAuth settings).

### Micro-App Download Fails

❌ **Problem**: Micro-apps are not downloading.  
✅ **Solution**:

- Ensure the backend API (`EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL`) is reachable.
- Check storage permissions if using file system storage.

### Firebase Files Not Found

❌ **Problem**: The build fails with an error indicating `GoogleService-Info.plist` or `google-services.json` is missing.  
✅ **Solution**:

- Ensure the `FIREBASE_IOS_PLIST_B64` and `FIREBASE_ANDROID_JSON_B64` variables in your `.env` file are not empty and contain valid Base64 strings.
- Try running `npm run write-firebase-files` manually to regenerate the files.
- If the issue persists, delete the `node_modules` directory and run `npm install` again.

### Firebase Plugin errors

❌ **Problem**: The build fails with an error caused by a firebase plugin during `npx expo prebuild` or `npx expo prebuild --clean`

✅ **Solution**: It was noticed that some firebase modules don't need to be added into the plugin list in the `app.config.js`. Remove the package and try re-running the commands
